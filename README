This is the offline test for ****.

The goal is pool detection on satellite pictures of parcels.

The data is that of the commune 06105 and can be found here:
https://cadastre.data.gouv.fr/data/etalab-cadastre/2019-01-01/geojson/communes/06/06105/cadastre-06105-parcelles.json.gz

I used a CNN to detect pool, and reached 95% accuracy. `foo.py` uses this model
to detect on the fly pools on IGN for a given parcel.
